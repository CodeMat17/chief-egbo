              covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is cast over

              people he will take away from all the earth; for the Lord has

              <br />
              Those who are led by God&apos;s spirit are God&apos;s sons. For
              what the Spirit God has given you does not make you slaves and
              cause you to be afraid; instead the Spirit makes you God&apos;s
              children and by the Spirit&apos;s power we cry out to our God,
              Abba Father! God&apos;s Spirit joins Himself to our Spirit to
              declare that we are God&apos;s children. Since we are His
              children, we will possess the blessings He keeps for his people,
              and we will also possess with Christ what God has kept for Him;
              for if we share Christ&apos;s su ering, we will also share his
              glory. <br />
              <br />I consider that what we su er at this present time cannot be
              compared at all, with the glory that is going to be revealed to
              us. All of creation waits with eager longing for God to reveal his
              sons. For creation was condemned to lose its purpose, not of its
              own will, but because God willed it to be so. Yet there was the
              hope that creation itself would one day be set free from its
              slavery to decay and would share the glorious freedom of the
              children of God. For we know that up to the present time all of
              creation groans with pain, like the pain of child birth. But it is
              not just creation alone which grown as we who have the spirit as
              the first of God&apos;s gifts also groan within ourselves as we
              wait for God to make us his sons and set our whole being free.

              Jesus said to his disciples: see that you are dressed for action
              and have your lamps lit. Be like a man waiting for their master to
              return from the wedding feast, ready to open the door as soon as
              he comes and knocks. Happy are those servants whom the master
              finds awake when he comes, I tell you solemnly, he will put on an
              apron, sit them down at table and wait on them. It may be in the
              second watch he comes, or in the third, but happy are those
              servants if he finds them ready. You may be quite sure of this,
              that if the house owner had known at which hour the burglar would
              come, he would not have let anyone break through the wall of his
              house. You must stand ready, because the son of man is coming at
              an hour you do not expect.
